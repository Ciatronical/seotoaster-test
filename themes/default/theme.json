One major San Francisco thoroughfare tallied that nearly 76% of the trips made on it yesterday were done by bike. Well done, San Francisco!<\/p>\n<p>The month of May is National Bike Month and we\u2019re happy to see so many people participating in Bike to Work Day. Of course, we think everyday should be Bike to Work Day for anyone who works less than 5 miles from home. In the Bay Area alone, more than one million Bay Area residents live within five miles of their workplace.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re considering biking to daily as part of your commute, but not sure where to start, check out the San Francisco Bike Coalition for maps and tips and more. If you\u2019re a bike-to-work regular or just getting into biking, drop us a line and let us know how your bike commute went yesterday<\/p>\n<p>Imagine how less congested our streets would be and how much healthier and happier people would be if more people made the choice to bicycle, walk, or take public transit to work.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re lucky to live in San Francisco where bicycling is a mainstream activity and the majority of our local elected officials recognize the value of bicycling. This year, 9 out of 11 local elected Board of Supervisors, our Mayor, and our District Attorney all participated in Bike to Work Day with thousands of other residents. Bike to Work Day helps remind these elected officials to fully fund and prioritize initiatives like Connecting the City which creates safe and accessible bikeways for anyone from 8 to 80 years old.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"_lbox\" href=\"{$website:url}media\/news\/original\/13953451818_45d9ff2b81_h.jpg\" title=\"13953451818_45d9ff2b81_h\"><img src=\"{$website:url}media\/news\/large\/13953451818_45d9ff2b81_h.jpg\" alt=\"13953451818_45d9ff2b81_h\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We know cities can get more people to bicycle if they create separated bikeways like this new one on Polk Street near City Hall.

From the increase in ridership (96% since 2006) to the influx of new bike shops (three new ones on Market Street alone) to the plethora of bike startups launching from our City by the Bay, one thing is clear: San Francisco loves biking.<\/p>\n<p>We sat down to talk with one of these new bike startups,&nbsp;Revolights, about the tie-in between new bike companies and bicycle advocacy. Here&rsquo;s what San Francisco native and Revolights&rsquo; Chief Marketing Officer, Drew Ocon, had to say about the combo. Revolights is one of the panelists in&nbsp;tonight&rsquo;s Bike Month event, Crowdfunding the Bike Industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>An incredible number of bike companies have launched in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Why do you think our area is ripe for such new bike innovation?<br \/><\/strong>It is amazing! Last time I checked, about 25% of all bicycle related Kickstarter projects are based here in California and mainly in the Bay Area, which goes to show that both entrepreneurship and cycling run deep in our blood. Back in the early 1900&prime;s, the Golden Gate Park Polo Fields were home to the first west coast velodrome, and in the &rsquo;70&prime;s, you&rsquo;d see pioneers like Joe Breeze, Gary Fisher and Tom Ritchey riding bikes down Mount Tam.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why does your company support the work of the SF Bicycle Coalition?<br \/><\/strong>We have always admired and respected what the SFBC has done to lead the way in bicycle safety and infrastructure. We share an affinity for bike safety and legitimizing bicycle commuting as a form of daily transportation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for the set of lights you gave to the winner of our Bike Commuter of the Year competition!

Of course, we think everyday should be Bike to Work Day for anyone who works less than 5 miles from home.

If you\u2019re a bike-to-work regular or just getting into biking, drop us a line and let us know how your bike commute went yesterday<\/p>\n<p>Imagine how less congested our streets would be and how much healthier and happier people would be if more people made the choice to bicycle, walk, or take public transit to work.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re lucky to live in San Francisco where bicycling is a mainstream activity and the majority of our local elected officials recognize the value of bicycling. This year, 9 out of 11 local elected Board of Supervisors, our Mayor, and our District Attorney all participated in Bike to Work Day with thousands of other residents. Bike to Work Day helps remind these elected officials to fully fund and prioritize initiatives like Connecting the City which creates safe and accessible bikeways for anyone from 8 to 80 years old.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"_lbox\" href=\"{$website:url}media\/news\/original\/13953451818_45d9ff2b81_h.jpg\" title=\"13953451818_45d9ff2b81_h\"><img src=\"{$website:url}media\/news\/large\/13953451818_45d9ff2b81_h.jpg\" alt=\"13953451818_45d9ff2b81_h\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We know cities can get more people to bicycle if they create separated bikeways like this new one on Polk Street near City Hall.
